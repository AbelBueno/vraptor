right now: 78/71

	test:
	- outjectioninterceptor
	- validator
	- methodlookup: test ignores non public, test ignores static
	
	3 path annotation with support to regex (niceurls?)
	
	5 v2: @Logic (parameters=...) support
	6 path annotation with support to dynamic logic and component lookup (niceurls?)
	
	7 v2: converters with access to request/session/context
	
	8 resolve interceptororder with interceptorstack
	- verify org.apache.log4j logs -> sl4j
	
	9 path annotation with support to value injection (niceurls?)
	
	10 v2: default Logic,Action and so on key removal
	
	11 v2: json output

	12 better than vraptor2: support for inheritance
	- v2: xml output

	13 converters: File
	
	14 support Validator
	
	15 concatenate convertion and validation errors

	16 hibernate validation plugin
	17 customizable error process on request execution
	18 404 component
19 ContainerBasedNullHandler support (non cached instances)
20 hibernate plugin
21 custom converters for specified method parameters
22 setting errors during ognl expression evaluation should be defined as validation errors
- default dir scanner misses unit tests
23 json output support
24 xml output support
25 better exception handling everywhere (prior)

- v2: lookup custom converter annotated field and complain?
- caelumweb use method FILL to app scope and request scope: adds to a list and adds on the run

- MAKE CACHE WORKS
- pico problem: STARTABLE/STOPABLE COMPONENTS with annotation + tests









	
site docs (prior to release)
- migration tutorial
- doc how to change the PathResolver algorithm
- doc how to use PageResult directly
- doc how to configure log
- faq xxx doesnt work: activate log
- note on converter lookup (injection system)... note that it might change???
- component are annotated by @Stereotyped annotations: right now: Resource and vraptor2 component
- better than vraptor2:
	- method parameters: list of custom type supported
	- enum converter: private enums (usually only locally used) supported
- migration
	- Provider config
	- plugins not supported
	- converters without access to LogicRequest automatically supported through vraptor.xml
- calendar support: either birthday or birthday.time
- BigDecimal, BigInteger converter
- paranamer
- vraptor2 with paranamer by default
- vraptor2 without paranamer: how to

kung help

- full spring support
	- Array
	Map support
- forward problem with opening 2 connections to the database and 2 components... one or two? solve it?














right before release
	copyright in all files check
	vraptor2 release with customized code
		the org.vraptor.Component annotation was modified
































ONLY AFTER RELEASE
- MIRROR usage as a fallback for OGNL instantiation
- MIRROR usage everywhere
- reflection fallback system on nullhandler (automatic?)
- CachedConverters and others should neve register(Class), they should do it at startup and clone those pico instances if faster... check it!
- all converter erros messages should contain the original value between '' so its clear in the message if it was empty (or null)
- test that checks that the main PicoContainer is not registered... and the converters interface is also not registered so it doesnt give the same converter to two different requests
- check all TODOS and do something about them
- allow private/protected constructors (search for every newInstance with getConstructor and setAccessible them, work it out with pico/mirror and so on)
- allow private/protected getters/setters
- method addAsNext on InterceptorStack could have another name, could have been another interface (same implmementation)?
- converters: jodatime
- accept do base interceptors are not being invoked
- time converters
- guice support
- SortedMap support
- BigInteger converter
- generic interface support: instantiates the implementation
- vraptor2 components with support for inherited outjection/injection
- vraptor2 logic with 2 names support
- niceurl extra features
- Logger.isDebugEnabled
- result interface as wished
- MAKE CONVERTERS GLOBAL, NOT LOCAL?
- extract the Interface/Implementation part from ReflectionBasedNullHandler
	- extra tests for Colleciton/List/and so on instantiate algorithm
- v2: support extra extensions 

	optimizations (product):
	- converter optimization
	- connection leak
	- static file lookup cache
	- filter optimization
	- transaction/ddc optimization
	- lookup for other common mistakes
	- deploy mode: complain about unused args/ignore unused args
	- support
	- extra vraptor2 compatibility procedures:
		- interceptor with restricted functionalities
		- plugins with restricted functionalities
		- custom lib
	- vraptor2 code analysis product
	- instantiate asm class only once
	- @In, @Out, @Read, @Parameter, @Logic(full support), @Component(full support)
	- dir lookup run only once (faster startup)
	- mistakes check removal: i.e. outjectioninterceptor ifs, assuming that the client code is just fine
	- log visualization tool
	- log per user on log file (so you can keep track of who did what and debug an specific user)
	- v2: getters for value injection if vraptor2 component, using vraptor2 crazy introspectors, otherwise vraptor3
	- v2 paranamer support if vraptor2 component
	- validate invalid parameter names in vraptor2 (duplicated names)
	- validate invalid parameter names in vraptor3 (duplicated names)
	- empty lists should be cached and early returned
	- cache EMPTY parameter class for method without parameters
	- parameter name provider needs cache? maybe
	- be able to throw an exception if wrong parameters are passed
	- vraptor2 validation method lookup: remove the search
	- vrapro2 customization: log/error/pre-check on wrong validation method parameters or similar name (edid distance < 2)
	- vraptor2/3 customization: log/error/pre-check on most validations (faster/error prone/etc) - pre-analysis tool base
	- v2: custom converters used on annotated fields
	- global converters annotation/local converter annotation
	- stats ala hibernate stats
	- statement product
	- graph product
	- ehcache
