help:
- Create example about how to create a VRaptor3 converter
- file list zips it
- bug: parameters are being set twice?
- JstlLocalization test
- MultipartInterceptor should be added only if jar is found on classpath
- make DefaultResourceTranslator work with jsessionid














	
site docs (prior to release)
- migration tutorial
- doc how to change the PathResolver algorithm
- doc how to use PageResult directly
- doc how to configure log
- faq xxx doesnt work: activate log
- note on converter lookup (injection system)... note that it might change???
- component are annotated by @Stereotyped annotations: right now: Resource and vraptor2 component
- better than vraptor2:
	- method parameters: list of custom type supported
	- enum converter: private enums (usually only locally used) supported
- migration
	- Provider config
	- plugins not supported
	- converters without access to LogicRequest automatically supported through vraptor.xml
- calendar support: either birthday or birthday.time
- BigDecimal, BigInteger converter
- paranamer
- vraptor2 with paranamer by default
- vraptor2 without paranamer: how to
- vraptor2 default LogicParameterAnnotationWithParanamerFallback: how to migrate when not using paranamer and annotation
- migration tutorial on every documented topic of vraptor2
	- might find useful things to support
- containers now can be @Request, @Session, @App scoped
- doc server side redirect with args:
	- pattern args always works
- hibernate plugin: aplicacoes de exemplo e documentacao
- Set support
	set[id==0].nome="guilherme"
	set[id==2].nome="guilherme"
	isso eh um mapa!
- doc: if you want default redirect, add the ForwardToDefaultViewInterceptor to your itnerceptor stack
- proxy creation: support also classes with non-default constructors, but will try to invoke all of them until one works.


kung help
	- add a @Listener 












right before release
	- better exception handling everywhere (search for TODO within exceptions): look at all new VRaptor and try to group them in new types
	- check all TODOS and do something about them
	go through every request component and check if it really needs to be request based
	verify org.apache.log4j logs -> sl4j
	copyright in all files check
	- read ALL todos
	vraptor2 release with customized code
		the org.vraptor.Component annotation was modified
		vraptor2 bug found: HibernateLogicMethod: params with more than one dot does not work: modified
			HibernateLogicMethod
			RecursiveFieldValidation
			EntireFieldValidation
			its interface
		class ExpressionEvaluator
				throw new ExpressionEvaluationException("Invalid redirection using: " + redirection);
	jira
	forum
	official support by caelum





























right before ANY release
	- check all TODOS and do something about them

ONLY AFTER RELEASE
- json outjecter from vraptor 2
- json outjecter with proxy support
- decide @Path priority
- Map support
	map[ENUM]-->
	map["a"]-->
	map[1]-->
	map[custom tambem]
	map[id==2]="por favor"
	map[id==2].nome="por favor"
	(map[id==2] eh o lado direito!!!)
- integration test for vraptor-example project e vraptor-spring-example
- json support through "Accepts", priorize _format
- returning InputStream could guess the result stream type
- refactor download interceptor: instead of 3 ifs, Map.contains, Map.get
welcome file list:
	- testar se da para try/catch 404 e ver o que acontece... passar um response wrapped??? sendError
	- known bug: accessing / when its /index.html.... if its a dir containing an index.html it doesnt work, but if your url is /clients/ it works...
- All common components should be located at BaseComponents, not only the ones pico can register so easily
- MultipartInterceptor.accepts() is never called, so it throws an exception everytime a request which isn't an multipart one is made
UserAgentInterceptor que permite usar isso: documentacao
SessionFormatInterceptor que seta na session: documentacao
- make client server redirect work with proxied parameters
3.0.1 - cache all method lookup algorithms (getDeclaredMethod())
- routes with support to withParam()
- Hibernate.validate(Object instance, String ... fields)
- Hibernate.validate(Object instance) : Proxy.getFirst(), Proxy.getSecond() will hibernate validate those fields
- DefaultLogicResult should cache enhancers in order to create objects
- Everywhere there is an Enhacer should cache enhancers
- AsmTypeCreator should cache instances
- DefaultRouter cache with cacheable routes
c) unit test for PicoContainersProvider... every scope should be tested
- migrate some vraptor2 functionalities already supported @Components to be supported @Resources too
3.0.1 - redirect to logic should work with parameter INJECTIon @ url also
- routes should tell if they are cacheable or not (* --> sucks, too many strings)
3.0.1 - method return != string --> outject
3.0.1 - method return == string --> default behaviour from vraptor 2
- method routeFor should return an interface, not an instance
- niceurls with file config support -> path support
3.0.1 - support to @Path(priority=...)...
3.0.1 - print out @Path priority (rules) debug info on startup
3.0.1 - maybe a lista lready exists and i set the items.. i would still have to remove the nulls
3.0.1 - nice url support as invoke(type).method(param("name1"),param("name2"))
- support i18n messages on hamcrest based validations
FileDownload support:
	- either return FileDownload
	- result.use(FileDownload)
- extract BUNDLEMESSAGE validation keys from converters
- if you instanceFor returns null on pico --> log debug???
3.0.1 - vraptor quartz component 
3.0.1 - extract VRaptor Validator
- Question: RequestResult should contain an Object so logics could execute a totally custom method???
3.0.1 - Register other caches
3.0.1 -  warn on views.properties redirect --> teach how to use the logicresult
ResourceMethod: two methods with the same name: Log.error
(3.0.1)ceci: time converters (igual ao Date e ao Calendar, so que usa Time.SHORT, ou pattern hh:mm, ver no vraptor2...)
	- nao cadastra-los por padrao
converters: jodatime (ver no vraptor2)
	- se o arquivo jodatime.jar estiver no classpath (use Class.forName com catch exception), loada automatico
	- se estiver no classpath, tem que adicionar os conversores atraves de reflection, nao pode referenciar nenhuma classe diretamente que referencia joda
converters:
	- localebased and fixed pattern version for decimal numbers, biginteger, bigdecimal and dates
(3.0.1)ceci: support generic Set with ognl (look at MiscOgnlSupportTest for generic list support - you need to create a SetAccessor)
(3.0.2) - xml output support
(3.0.1) MultiPartInterceptor config
- customizable error process on request execution
- each Provider should have a getComponentsToTest template method
- common-fileupload is mandatory, make it optional by only registering the interceptor if on the classpath
	- same thing with hibernate's validator plugin interceptor and vraptor2
- DDD related: ContainerBasedNullHandler support (non cached instances)
- better than vpraptor2: niceurl route caching	
- better tha vraptor2: faster niceurl parsing when matching
- RequestParameters implementation for POSTed xml and json values.
- MIRROR usage as a fallback for OGNL instantiation
- MIRROR usage everywhere
- reflection fallback system on nullhandler (automatic?)
- CachedConverters and others should neve register(Class), they should do it at startup and clone those pico instances if faster... check it!
- all converter erros messages should contain the original value between '' so its clear in the message if it was empty (or null)
- test that checks that the main PicoContainer is not registered... and the converters interface is also not registered so it doesnt give the same converter to two different requests
- allow private/protected constructors (search for every newInstance with getConstructor and setAccessible them, work it out with pico/mirror and so on)
- allow private/protected getters/setters
- method addAsNext on InterceptorStack could have another name, could have been another interface (same implmementation)?
- accept do base interceptors are not being invoked
- guice support
- SortedMap support
- generic interface support: instantiates the implementation
- vraptor2 components with support for inherited outjection/injection
- vraptor2 logic with 2 names support
- Logger.isDebugEnabled
- result interface as wished
- MAKE CONVERTERS GLOBAL, NOT LOCAL?
- extract the Interface/Implementation part from ReflectionBasedNullHandler
	- extra tests for Colleciton/List/and so on instantiate algorithm
- v2: support extra extensions 
- v2: converters with access to request/session/context
- niceurls extra routes
- refactor ParametersInstantiator into MethodParameters constructor?
- vraptor forward config with request/forward/optional include
- v2: xml output
- refactor all interceptors from RequestExecution inside the DefaultInterceptorStack or InterceptorRegistry so it always load. 
	- this way, the Execution bla bla should always ask the accept method before proceeding
- MAKE CACHE WORKS
	support vraptor2 plugins if possible:
		- what else?
	- v2: lookup custom converter annotated field and complain?
- path annotation with support to dynamic logic and component lookup (niceurls?)
- custom converters for specified method parameters
- v2: support for session scoped components for constructor injection
- support to method return != string --> outject
	- do not do it if @Component vrraptor2

OgnlGenericTypesSupportTest:

        Object[] params = provider.getParametersFor(mockery.methodFor(MyResource.class, "buyA", House.class));
        House house = (House) params[0];

        assertThat(house.extraCats.get(0).id, is(equalTo("guilherme")));

    }


	optimizations (product):
	- component instances without any logging (faster proceedings)
	- cluster (v2, v3?)
	- converter optimization
	- connection leak
	- (optimization) static file lookup cache
	- (optimization) filter optimization
	- (support) lookup for common mistakes:
		- example: two components with the same name, same method name (same path)
	- deploy mode: complain about request unused args/ignore request unused args
	- support
	- extra vraptor2 compatibility procedures:
		- interceptor with restricted functionalities
		- plugins with restricted functionalities
		- custom lib
		- @In, @Out, @Read, @Parameter, @Logic(full support), @Component(full support)
		- v2: getters for value injection if vraptor2 component, using vraptor2 crazy introspectors, otherwise vraptor3
		- v2 paranamer support if vraptor2 component
		- v2: custom converters used on annotated fields
		- v2: migration without paranamer and annotation (defaultprovider)
		- v2: complain about parameter annotation on @Logic when not usingthe correct number of values (same as parameters)
	- vraptor2 code analysis product
		- migrator
	- (optimization) instantiate asm class only once
	- (optimization) dir lookup run only once (faster startup)
	- mistakes check removal: i.e. outjectioninterceptor ifs, assuming that the client code is just fine
	
	- totally new:
		- log visualization tool
		- log per user on log file (so you can keep track of who did what and debug an specific user)
		- stats ala hibernate stats
		
	- validate invalid parameter names in vraptor2 (duplicated names)
	- validate invalid parameter names in vraptor3 (duplicated names)
	- (optimization) empty lists should be cached and early returned
	- (optimization) cache EMPTY parameter class for method without parameters
	- (optimization) parameter name provider needs cache? maybe
	- (optimization) vraptor2 validation method lookup: remove the search
	- vrapro2 customization: log/error/pre-check on wrong validation method parameters or similar name (edid distance < 2)
	- vraptor2/3 customization: log/error/pre-check on most validations (faster/error prone/etc) - pre-analysis tool base
	- (optimization) global converters annotation/local converter annotation
	- statement product
	- graph product
	- ehcache
	- niceurl injection cache component
	- niceurl and common path two components for one url live detection (for  integration test or live)
	- niceurl cache (so the previous thing is not a problem)
	- (optimization) internal component cache limits (due to niceurl which might be huge)
	- log when trying to register a component with no interface
